## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-30

- Q: このシステムをどのように利用できるようにしますか？（CLI、ライブラリAPI、両方） → A: 両方（プログラムから利用可能なAPIとユーザーインターフェースの両方を提供）
- Q: このシステムで管理する文書パスの想定数はどのくらいですか？ → A: 中規模（約10,000件）- チームや部門での利用レベル
- Q: このシステムは複数のユーザーが同時にアクセスすることを想定していますか？ → A: 複数ユーザー（読み取りのみ共有）- 複数ユーザーが同時に閲覧可能だが、更新は排他的
- Q: 同じファイルパスを複数回登録しようとした場合、システムはどう動作すべきですか？ → A: 文書種類ごとにルールベースでパスを自動生成し、rootディレクトリとパス生成ルールを定義することで一意性を保証
- Q: システムは絶対パスと相対パス、どちらを扱いますか？ → A: 絶対パスのみ。WindowsのUNCパス（\\server\share\...形式のネットワークパス）もサポート
- Q: ユーザーが文書へのアクセスや作成を試みる際、システムはどのような認証・認可メカニズムを使用すべきですか？ → A: 最終的には外部認証委譲（SSO/LDAP/AD）だが、当初は認証なし（ホスティング環境で事前認証済みと想定し、部署/課の権限チェックのみ実施）
- Q: システムがログ、メトリクス、監視データを生成する必要がありますか？運用上の可観測性（observability）についてどのレベルが必要ですか？ → A: 不要 - ログや監視機能は必要なし
- Q: 文書パスデータの保持期間やアーカイブ、削除ポリシーについて、どのように扱うべきですか？ → A: AおよびD（永続保持 + 論理削除 - 削除フラグを立てるが実データは保持、監査目的）
- 追加要件: ユーザーと文書種類は部署に紐づく。文書は業務に紐づく。
- 文書番号フォーマット: **文書種類ごとに異なるルールを定義可能**
  - 例1: AGI-2509001 = A(文書種類) + G(部門) + I(課) + 2509(年月) + 001(連番)
  - 例2: りん議I-25009 = りん議(文書種類) + I(課) + - + 25(年) + 009(連番、月なし)
  - 各文書種類に対して、独自の番号生成ルール（使用する要素、順序、セパレーター、桁数など）とrootディレクトリを定義

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story

As a department user, I want to manage document file paths through a flexible rule-based automatic path generation system where each document type can have its own unique numbering format and root directory, so that I can efficiently organize documents according to different document type requirements without manually maintaining path information.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a document type "A" is defined with rule format `[Type][Dept][Section][YYMM][NNN]` and root directory `/docs/contracts/`, **When** a user in GI section creates a new document of type A in September 2025, **Then** the system generates document number "AGI-2509001" and stores path `/docs/contracts/AGI-2509001.pdf`
2. **Given** a document type "りん議" is defined with rule format `[Type][Section]-[YY][NNN]` and root directory `/docs/ringi/`, **When** a user in section I creates a ringi document in 2025, **Then** the system generates document number "りん議I-25009" and stores path `/docs/ringi/りん議I-25009.pdf`
3. **Given** I am a user in department "K" section "T", **When** I create a document, **Then** the system uses document types configured for my department and section
4. **Given** a document is created, **When** I associate it with a business task, **Then** the system stores the business task reference
5. **Given** the database is empty, **When** I add a new document path, **Then** the path is stored successfully and assigned a unique identifier
6. **Given** a document path exists in the database, **When** I search by document number (e.g., "AGI-2509001" or "りん議I-25009"), **Then** the system returns the correct document path
7. **Given** multiple document paths exist, **When** I query all paths, **Then** the system returns a complete list of stored paths
8. **Given** a document path exists, **When** I update its path value, **Then** the new path is stored and the document number remains unchanged
9. **Given** a document path exists, **When** I delete it by document number, **Then** the path is removed from the database
10. **Given** a document type with a path generation rule, **When** I query documents by type, **Then** the system returns all paths for that document type
11. **Given** I am a user in a department, **When** I query documents by business task, **Then** the system returns all documents associated with that task
12. **Given** multiple documents exist with type "りん議" in year 25, **When** the auto-increment reaches りん議I-25999, **Then** the system handles counter overflow appropriately

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a duplicate path is added? System MUST prevent duplicates through rule-based path generation
- How does system handle invalid file paths? System MUST validate path format (absolute paths for Unix/Linux, Windows local drives, and Windows UNC paths) and reject invalid formats
- What happens when querying a non-existent identifier? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Return empty result or error?]
- What happens when multiple users attempt to update the same path simultaneously? System MUST reject concurrent write attempts and notify the user
- What happens when the path points to a file that no longer exists on disk? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Track file existence or just store paths?]
- What happens when the auto-increment counter reaches its maximum (999 or configured digit limit)? System MUST return an error indicating counter exhaustion and notify administrators. For month-based counters, the counter resets in the next month; for year-based counters, the counter resets in the next year.
- How does system handle changes to path generation rules for existing documents? System MUST maintain backwards compatibility with previously generated paths (existing documents retain their original numbers)
- How does system handle cross-platform path differences (Unix/Windows)? System MUST store paths as-is and handle platform-specific formats correctly
- What happens when a user attempts to create a document with a type not associated with their department and section? System MUST reject the operation and notify the user
- How does system handle department restructuring (users moving between departments)? System MUST maintain historical document ownership while allowing department updates
- How does system handle multi-byte characters in document type codes (りん議, 教育) in file paths? System MUST properly encode and handle UTF-8 or other appropriate character encoding
